## 1.0.3 (July 21, 2021)

ENHANCEMENTS

* `terraform plan`: The JSON logs (`-json` option) will now include `resource_drift`, showing changes detected outside of Terraform during the refresh step. ([#29072](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29072))
* core: The automatic provider installer will now accept providers that are recorded in their registry as using provider protocol version 6. ([#29153](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29153))
* backend/etcdv3: New argument `max_request_bytes` allows larger requests and for the client, to match the server request limit. ([#28078](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28078))

BUG FIXES:

* `terraform plan`: Will no longer panic when trying to render null maps. ([#29207](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29207))
* backend/pg: Prevent the creation of multiple workspaces with the same name. ([#29157](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29157))
* backend/oss: STS auth is now supported. ([#29167](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29167))

* config: Unknown values in string templates could lose sensitivity, causing the planned change to be inaccurate ([#29208](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29208))

## 1.0.2 (July 07, 2021)

BUG FIXES:

* `terraform show`: Fix crash when rendering JSON plan with sensitive values in state ([#29049](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29049))
* config: The `floor` and `ceil` functions no longer lower the precision of arguments to what would fit inside a 64-bit float, instead preserving precision in a similar way as most other arithmetic functions. ([#29110](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29110))
* config: The `flatten` function was incorrectly treating null values of an unknown type as if they were unknown values. Now it will treat them the same as any other non-list/non-tuple value, flattening them down into the result as-is. ([#29110](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29110))

## 1.0.1 (June 24, 2021)

ENHANCEMENTS:

* `terraform show`: The JSON plan output now indicates which state values are sensitive. ([#28889](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28889))
* cli: The macOS builds will now resolve hostnames using the system's DNS resolver, rather than the Go library's (incomplete) emulation of it. In particular, this will allow for the more complex resolver configurations often created by VPN clients on macOS, such as when a particular domain must be resolved using different nameservers while VPN connection is active.

BUG FIXES:

* `terraform show`: Fix crash with deposed instances in json plan output. ([#28922](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28922))
* `terraform show`: Fix an issue where the JSON configuration representation was missing fully-unwrapped references. ([#28884](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28884))

* core: Fix crash when provider modifies and unknown block during plan. ([#28941](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28941))
* core: Diagnostic context was missing for some errors when validating blocks. ([#28979](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28979))
* core: Fix crash when calling `setproduct` with unknown values. ([#28984](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28984))
* backend/remote: Fix faulty Terraform Cloud version check when migrating state to the remote backend with multiple local workspaces. ([#28864](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28864))

## 1.0.0 (June 08, 2021)

Terraform v1.0 is an unusual release in that its primary focus is on stability, and it represents the culmination of several years of work in previous major releases to make sure that the Terraform language and internal architecture will be a suitable foundation for forthcoming additions that will remain backward compatible.

Terraform v1.0.0 intentionally has no significant changes compared to Terraform v0.15.5. You can consider the v1.0 series as a direct continuation of the v0.15 series; we do not intend to issue any further releases in the v0.15 series, because all of the v1.0 releases will be only minor updates to address bugs.

For all future minor releases with major version 1, we intend to preserve backward compatibility as described in detail in [the Terraform v1.0 Compatibility Promises](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/v1-compatibility-promises.html). The later Terraform v1.1.0 will, therefore, be the first minor release with new features that we will implement with consideration of those promises.
